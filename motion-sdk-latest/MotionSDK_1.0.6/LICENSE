ACTIVE THEORY SDK AGREEMENT 
(NON-COMMERCIAL/INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY) 

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT AND ANY ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION (COLLECTIVELY, “SDK”) MADE AVAILABLE BY ACTIVE THEORY, INC. (“ACTIVE THEORY”). THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS ACTIVE THEORY SDK AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SDK UNLESS YOU AND ACTIVE THEORY HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT. 

Active Theory is willing to license the SDK to you only upon the condition that you accept all the terms contained in this Agreement. By marking the “I accept SDK terms and conditions” box or by downloading, installing, using or accessing the SDK, you have indicated that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. If you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of an organization or company, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization or company to this Agreement. If you do not accept all the terms of this Agreement, then Active theory is unwilling to license the SDK to you and you should not download, install, use or access the SDK. 

1. Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Active Theory hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and reproduce the SDK in source and object code form for the sole purpose of internally developing prototype gaming applications (any such applications developed through the use of the SDK, “Games”). Active Theory reserves all rights in the SDK not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. 

2. Restrictions. Except as expressly specified in this Agreement, you may not: (a) copy or modify the SDK; (b) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the SDK to any third party; (c) make the functionality of the SDK available to multiple users through any means, including, without, limitation, by uploading the SDK to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services provider, service bureau or any other type of services, or (d) distribute or publish any Games. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE SDK IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY WITH NO DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. IF YOU DECIDE TO DISTRIBUTE OR PUBLISH ANY GAMES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FREELY DOWNLOADABLE GAMES), YOU WILL NEED TO ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH ACTIVE THEORY. You acknowledge and agree that the software included in the SDK constitutes or contains trade secrets of Active Theory and its licensors. Accordingly, you agree not to disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer the SDK, in whole or in part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by law notwithstanding this prohibition. You agree to comply fully with all U.S. export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the SDK nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof are exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations. 

3. Updates. Active Theory is under no obligation to maintain or support or update the SDK in any way, or to provide updates or error corrections. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Active Theory provides you with a bug fix, maintenance release or update to the SDK, it is provided and will be considered subject to the terms of this license, unless you receive a separate license from Active Theory for that release or update that expressly supersedes this Agreement. 

4. Ownership. The SDK is licensed, not sold and Active Theory retains ownership thereof, including all intellectual property rights therein. 

5. Term. This Agreement remains effective until terminated. You may terminate it at any time by destroying all copies of the SDK in your possession or control. This Agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you breach any term of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must promptly destroy all copies of the SDK in your possession or control. 

6. No Warranty. The SDK IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ACTIVE THEORY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE RELATIVE TO THE SDK OR ANY GAMES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM ACTIVE THEORY OR ELSEWHERE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. 

7. Limitation of Liability. ACTIVE THEORY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS. IN NO EVENT WILL ACTIVE THEORY BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) OR FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK OR ANY GAMES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT ACTIVE THEORY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

8. Indemnity. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Active Theory harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs), as incurred, arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, action or proceeding brought against Active Theory (a “Claim”) arising from your use of the SDK. Active Theory reserves the right to retain counsel, at its own expense, to participate in the defense and settlement of the Claim 

9. Confidentiality. The SDK is the confidential information of Active Theory and you agree not to use the SDK except as necessary to exercise your rights under this Agreement and will not disclose such confidential information to any third party except to those of your employees and subcontractors that need to know such confidential information for the purpose of performing this Agreement, provided that each such employee or subcontractor is subject to a written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are at least as protective as those set forth herein. You agree to use all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of Active Theory’s confidential information, but in no event less than the efforts that you ordinarily use with respect to your own proprietary information of similar importance. 

10. General. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without Active Theory’s prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void and of no effect. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. All notices or approvals required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by confirmed facsimile transmission, by overnight delivery service, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt. All notices or approvals will be sent to the addresses as may be specified by either party to the other in accordance with this section. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all proposals, understandings or communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding its subject matter, unless you and Active Theory have executed a separate agreement. Each party agrees to comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection with its activities under this Agreement.
